## Election - Audit Summary
This scipt can be used for any future election. While this specific code provided information on winning candidates and voter turnout by county, the scipt can be modifed to can capture other election datafields and determine election results like the outcome of a proposed bill for example or more in depth voter demographic information like age and gender. In addition to capturing different datafields, we can modify the output to give us a different resutls message.
